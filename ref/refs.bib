  abstract={The operation of JT-60U reversed shear discharges has been extended to a high plasma current, low q regime keeping a large radius of the internal transport barrier (ITB), and a record value of equivalent fusion multiplication factor in JT-60U, Q DT eq = 1.25, has been achieved at 2.6 MA. Operational schemes to reach the low q regime with good reproducibility have been developed. The reduction of Z eff was obtained in the newly installed W shaped pumped divertor. The β limit in the low q min regime, which limited the performance of L mode edge discharges, has been improved in H mode edge discharges with a broader pressure profile, which was obtained by power flow control with ITB degradation. Sustainment of the ITB and improved confinement for 5.5 s has been demonstrated in an ELMy H mode reversed shear discharge.}

  abstract={High fusion power experiments using DT mixtures in ELM-free H mode and optimized shear regimes in JET are reported. A fusion power of 16.1 MW has been produced in an ELM-free H mode at 4.2 MA/3.6 T. The transient value of the fusion amplification factor was 0.95±0.17, consistent with the high value of n DT (0)τ E dia T i (0) = 8.7 × 10 20 ±20% m -3 s keV, and was maintained for about half an energy confinement time until excessive edge pressure gradients resulted in discharge termination by MHD instabilities. The ratio of DD to DT fusion powers (from separate but otherwise similar discharges) showed the expected factor of 210, validating DD projections of DT performance for similar pressure profiles and good plasma mixture control, which was achieved by loading the vessel walls with the appropriate DT mix. Magnetic fluctuation spectra showed no evidence of Alfvénic instabilities driven by alpha particles, in agreement with theoretical model calculations. Alpha particle heating has been unambiguously observed, its effect being separated successfully from possible isotope effects on energy confinement by varying the tritium concentration in otherwise similar discharges. The scan showed that there was no, or at most a very weak, isotope effect on the energy confinement time. The highest electron temperature was clearly correlated with the maximum alpha particle heating power and the optimum DT mixture; the maximum increase was 1.3±0.23 keV with 1.3 MW of alpha particle heating power, consistent with classical expectations for alpha particle confinement and heating. In the optimized shear regime, clear internal transport barriers were established for the first time in DT, with a power similar to that required in DD. The ion thermal conductivity in the plasma core approached neoclassical levels. Real time power control maintained the plasma core close to limits set by pressure gradient driven MHD instabilities, allowing 8.2 MW of DT fusion power with n DT (0)τ E dia T i (0) ≈ 10 21 m -3 s keV, even though full optimization was not possible within the imposed neutron budget. In addition, quasi-steady-state discharges with simultaneous internal and edge transport barriers have been produced with high confinement and a fusion power of up to 7 MW; these double barrier discharges show a great potential for steady state operation. © 1999, Euratom}

  abstract={The paper highlights the JET work in physics and technology during the period of the JET Joint Undertaking (1978-1999), with special emphasis on what has been learned for extrapolation to a NEXT STEP device. - Global confinement scaling has been extended to high currents and heating powers. Dimensionless scaling experiments of ELMy H mode plasmas suggest that bulk plasma transport is gyro-Bohm and predict ignition for a device with ITER-FDR parameters. Experiments in which the plasma elongation and triangularity were varied independently show a strong increase of confinement time with elongation (τ E ~ κ a 0.8 ± 0.3 ), thus supporting a basic design principle of ITER-FEAT. With the Pellet Enhanced Performance (PEP) mode, JET has discovered the beneficial effect of reversed magnetic shear on confinement, opening the possibility of advanced tokamak scenarios. - With a three stage programme of progressively more closed divertors, JET has demonstrated the benefits of divertor closure, in particular, of high divertor neutral pressure which facilitates helium removal. It has also shown that in detached (or semidetached) radiative divertor plasmas the average power load on the target plates of a NEXT STEP device should be tolerable but, in addition, that the transient power loads during ELMs could cause problems. - In 1991 JET has demonstrated the first ever controlled production of a megawatt of fusion power. More extensive D-T experiments in 1997 (DTE1) have established new records in fusion performance: 16 MW transient fusion power with Q in = 0.62 (i.e. close to breakeven, Q in = 1) and 4 MW steady state fusion power with Q in = 0.18 for 4 s. DTE1 has also allowed a successful test of various reactor ICRF heating schemes and a clear demonstration of alpha particle heating, consistent with classical expectations. - JET has developed and tested some of the most important technologies for a NEXT STEP and a reactor, in particular the safe handling of tritium and the remote handling of large equipment as demonstrated by the Remote Divertor Exchange following DTE1.}

The neutral particles experience excitation and ionization by collisions with electrons and ions as they penetrate into a plasma. The emitted characteristic line radiation is Doppler shifted and the spectral lines are split due to motional Stark fields. Measurements of wavelength, intensity and polarization of the Balmer- alpha emission reveal information about the neutral beam, such as beam attenuation, beam-geometry, beam-divergence and species mix. Local pitch angles and toroidal fields can be derived from the simultaneous measurement of the polarization pattern and the wavelength separation of the Stark multiplet. The implementation and application of beam emission spectroscopy as a quantitative diagnostic tool on the Joint European Torus (JET) experiment is reviewed.}

  abstract={The physical processes producing electron particle transport in the core of tokamak plasmas are described. Starting from the gyrokinetic equation, a simple analytical derivation is used as guidance to illustrate the main mechanisms driving turbulent particle convection. A review of the experimental observations on particle transport in tokamaks is presented and the consistency with the theoretical predictions is discussed. An overall qualitative agreement, and in some cases even a specific quantitative agreement, emerges between complex theoretical predictions and equally complex experimental observations, exhibiting different dependences on plasma parameters under different regimes. By these results, the direct connection between macroscopic transport properties and the character of microscopic turbulence is pointed out, and an important confirmation of the paradigm of microinstabilities and turbulence as the main cause of transport in the core of tokamaks is obtained. Finally, the impact of these results on the prediction of the peaking of the electron density profile in a fusion reactor is illustrated.}

Plasmas are produced in a helicon plasma source. A rf compensated Langmuir probe is used to measure both the electron temperature and plasma density while a spectrometer is used to measure He I line intensities from the plasma. For all plasma densities where the electron temperature remains at 5 ± 1 eV, three He line ratios are measured. Each experimental ratio is compared with the prediction of three different collisional radiative models. One of these models makes uses of recent R-matrix with pseudo-states calculations for collisional rate coefficients. A discussion related to the different observations and model predictions is presented.}

  abstract={Beam emission spectroscopy on thermal helium is used at the TEXTOR tokamak as a reliable method to obtain radial profiles of electron temperature T e ( r , t ) and electron density n e ( r , t ). In this paper the experimental realization of this method at TEXTOR and the status of the atomic physics employed as well as the major factors for the measurement's accuracy are evaluated. On the experimental side, the hardware specifications are described and the impact of the beam atoms on the local plasma parameters is shown to be negligible. On the modeling side the collisional–radiative model (CRM) applied to infer n e and T e from the measured He line intensities is evaluated. The role of proton and deuteron collisions and of charge exchange processes is studied with a new CRM and the impact of these so far neglected processes appears to be of minor importance. Direct comparison to Thomson scattering and fast triple probe data showed that for high densities n e > 3.5 × 10 19  m −3 the T e values deduced with the established CRM are too low. However, the new atomic data set implemented in the new CRM leads in general to higher T e values. This allows us to specify the range of reliable application of BES on thermal helium to a range of 2.0 × 10 18 < n e < 2.0 × 10 19  m −3 and 10 eV < T e < 250 eV which can be extended by routine application of the new CRM.}

  abstract={Charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (CXRS) based on a diagnostic neutral beam (DNB) installed in the HT-7 tokamak is introduced. DNB can provide a 6 A extracted current at 50 kV for 0.1 s in hydrogen. It can penetrate into the core plasma in HT-7. The CXRS system is designed to observe charge exchange (CX) transitions in the visible spectrum. CX light from the beam is focused onto 10 optical fibers, which view the plasma from −5 cm to 20 cm. The CXRS system can measure the ion temperature as low as 0.1 keV. With CXRS, the local ion temperature profile in HT-7 was obtained for the first time.}

Simulation results show that the inversion accuracy is associated with the angular expansion limit and the hot core displacement. In addition, tomographic results of sawtooth oscillations in a typical low hybrid current drive (LHCD) plasma are presented. It is shown that the reconstructions are reliable to analyze the perturbative mode and the evolution.}

  abstract={The intermediate oscillatory phase during the L–H transition, termed the I-phase, is studied in the EAST superconducting tokamak using a newly developed dual gas puff imaging (GPI) system near the L–H transition power threshold. The experimental observations suggest that the oscillatory behaviour appearing at the L–H transition could be induced by the synergistic effect of the two components of the sheared m , n = 0 E × B flow, i.e. the turbulence-driven zonal flow (ZF) and the equilibrium flow. The latter arises from the equilibrium, and is, to leading order, balanced by the ion diamagnetic term in the radial force balance equation. A slow increase in the poloidal flow and its shear at the plasma edge are observed tens of milliseconds prior to the I-phase. During the I-phase, the turbulence recovery appears to originate from the vicinity of the separatrix with clear wave fronts propagating both outwards into the far scrape-off layer (SOL) and inwards into the core plasma. The turbulence Reynolds stress is directly measured using the GPI system during the I-phase, providing direct evidence of kinetic energy transfer from turbulence to ZFs at the plasma edge. The GPI observations strongly suggest that the SOL transport physics and the evolution of pressure gradient near the separatrix play an important role in the L–I–H transition dynamics. To highlight these new physics, the previous predator–prey model is extended to include a new equation for the SOL physics. The model successfully reproduces the L–I–H transition process with several features comparing favourably with GPI observations.}

Main experiments in the start phase will be involved with breakdown and plasma current set-up with a mode of saving volt-second and without ohmic heating system, equilibrium and instability, current driving, heating and profile modification. The SUNIST is a university-scale conceptual spherical tokamak, with R = 0.3 m, A 1.3, I p ~ 50 kA, B T < 0.15 T, and P RF = 100 kW. The only peculiarity of SUNIST is that there is a toroidal insulating break along the outer wall of vacuum vessel. The expected that advantages of this arrangement are helpful not only for saving flux swing, but also for having a deep understanding of what will influence the discharge startup and globe performances of plasma under different conditions of strong vessel eddy and ECR power assistance. Of course, the vessel structure of cross seal will be at a great risk of controlling vacuum quality, although we have achieved positive results on simulation test and vacuum vessel test.}

The characteristics of the edge electrostatic fluctuations and the turbulence-induced transport are experimentally investigated. The results show that a naturally formed E r × B ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/phgr.gif] {phgr} poloidal velocity shear layer (VSL) exists near the radial location of the limiter. Wavenumber spectrum analyses show that edge fluctuations have a radial propagation character of the drift wave turbulence, with a characteristic radial phase velocity v ph r ~ 0.7 km s −1 in the scrape-off-layer and v ph r ~ 0.9–1.4 km s −1 at plasma edge, suggesting that the edge turbulence may originate from the core and propagate to the edge in an intermittent pattern. A radial profile of the toroidal flow velocity Mach number has been observed whose maximum is just located at the VSL position, which may imply a possible relation between the poloidal shear flow and the toroidal plasma flow in SUNIST.}

A first approximation to the solution of the coupled integro-differential equations is obtained by neglecting energy differences (the E.R. approximation). A comparison is made between the cross-sections calculated using exact solutions of the E.R. equations and using weak coupling approximations to these solutions. It is found that, although allowance for distortion gives a considerable improvement, the weak coupling approximations cannot in general be relied upon to give accurate results. Estimates of the magnitudes of the terms omitted in the E.R. approximation are made by perturbation methods, and in all cases these terms are found to be reasonably small. Final values for the cross-sections are probably correct to within $\pm $ 40% in absolute value and rather more accurate than this in the relative values. Cross-sections estimated for a number of other ions of astrophysical interest are considered to be correct to within a factor of 2. Hartree-Fock wave functions for N II are given in an appendix.},

  abstract={The neutral helium line intensity ratios 667.8 nm/728.1 nm and 728.1 nm/706.5 nm are measured at JET to provide essential information on the parallel and radial profiles of electron density and temperature both above and at the divertor targets. The accuracy of the derived electron density and temperature values depends on the uncertainties in the atomic data used to calculate line intensity ratios. Work has been carried out to assess the sensitivity of the population calculations to typical uncertainties in the electron impact excitation rate coefficients using ADAS (Atomic Data and Analysis Structure). We find that the uncertainty in the 3s 1 S-3p 1 P excitation rate dominates the error in the line ratios.}

  abstract={The paper presents an integrated view of the population structure and its role in establishing the ionization state of light elements in dynamic, finite density, laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. There are four main issues, the generalized collisional–radiative picture for metastables in dynamic plasmas with Maxwellian free electrons and its particularizing to light elements, the methods of bundling and projection for manipulating the population equations, the systematic production/use of state selective fundamental collision data in the metastable resolved picture to all levels for collisonal–radiative modelling and the delivery of appropriate derived coefficients for experiment analysis. The ions of carbon, oxygen and neon are used in illustration. The practical implementation of the methods described here is part of the ADAS Project.}

abstract = "The knowledge of the electron temperature profiles Te(r) in the boundary of a tokamak is important in several regards, e.g., for the calculation of impurity fluxes from line intensities, for an estimate of the radiation losses in the boundary, and for the modelling of the particle and power fluxes in the scrape-off layer. Since other diagnostic methods have not offered satisfactory solutions so far, we have developed a diagnostic technique which is based on the measurement of the radial intensity profiles of selected lines emitted by an injected thermal He-atom beam. For this purpose 4.8×1018 atoms/s at 150°C are injected into the plasma through a collimating hole structure. Due to the high ionization potential of 24.59 eV, the He-atoms penetrate several centimeters beyond the limiter radius into the plasma (ne×l=2×1013 cm−2). The line intensities at two wavelengths (λ1=706.52 nm and λ2=728.13 nm) are recorded simultaneously with linear 128 elements array cameras, and their intensity ratio is compared with values calculated from a collisional radiative model in order to obtain Te(r). The accessible range is 10 eV≤Te≤150 eV, which nearly closes the gap between the outer channel of the core diagnostics and probe measurements in the plasma edge. The lower limit is determined by the relaxation length of the He-beam entering the plasma whereas the upper limit is given by the penetration depth of the He-atoms. In our case the spatial and the temporal resolution is 1.2 mm, resp. 10 ms. By selecting another line at λ3=667.82 nm and taking the line intensity ratio of λ2 the electron density profiles can be obtained simultaneously allowing a self-consistent development of the data. "

(1) The phase shift between two vertical probing beams located at a distance of x/a = ±0.6 from the vessel centre yields the difference of electron line densities along these trajectories and indicates displacements or asymmetries of the density profile. (2) Faraday rotation measurements on a probing beam passing vertically through the vessel centre allow horizontal shifts of the magnetic flux surfaces to be detected. Both the phase shift and Faraday rotation signals have been applied as control quantities to the TEXTOR feedback system, resulting in good positional stability for discharge durations of more than 2.5 seconds.}

Corrections are made for the presence of ground-state atoms and a very small concentration of highly excited atoms. The semiquantal binary encounter data agree satisfactorily up to 20 eV, but less well at higher energies. From 200 to 1000 eV, the measured data agree well with Bethe-Born cross sections of Briggs and Kim (1971) for He(2 3 S) provided a correction is made to take account of a spurious contribution to the ionization signal which is only significant at the higher energies. All the various Born cross sections, at high energies, are substantially lower than the present measurements and also the Bethe-Born data, but they are either comparable with or smaller than the measured cross section at its peak.}

Elastic, excitation, and ionization processes are considered, as well as excitation of the metastable states. The present status of agreement between theory and experiment for elastic and discrete excitations of the ground-state is, in our view, quite satisfactory. However, discrepancies for excitation of the metastable states are substantial and invite urgent attention. Application of the CCC method to the calculation of differential ionization cross sections is encouraging, but also shows some fundamental difficulties.}

  abstract={In order to support the operation of ITER and the planned experimental programme an extensive set of plasma and first wall measurements will be required. The number and type of required measurements will be similar to those made on the present-day large tokamaks while the specification of the measurements?time and spatial resolutions, etc?will in some cases be more stringent. Many of the measurements will be used in the real time control of the plasma driving a requirement for very high reliability in the systems (diagnostics) that provide the measurements. The implementation of diagnostic systems on ITER is a substantial challenge. Because of the harsh environment (high levels of neutron and gamma fluxes, neutron heating, particle bombardment) diagnostic system selection and design has to cope with a range of phenomena not previously encountered in diagnostic design. Extensive design and R&D is needed to prepare the systems. In some cases the environmental difficulties are so severe that new diagnostic techniques are required. The starting point in the development of diagnostics for ITER is to define the measurement requirements and develop their justification. It is necessary to include all the plasma parameters needed to support the basic and advanced operation (including active control) of the device, machine protection and also those needed to support the physics programme. Once the requirements are defined, the appropriate (combination of) diagnostic techniques can be selected and their implementation onto the tokamak can be developed. The selected list of diagnostics is an important guideline for identifying dedicated research and development needs in the area of ITER diagnostics. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of recent progress in the field of ITER diagnostics with emphasis on the implementation issues. After a discussion of the measurement requirements for plasma parameters in ITER and their justifications, recent progress in the field of diagnostics to measure a selected set of plasma parameters is presented. The integration of the various diagnostic systems onto the ITER tokamak is described. Generic research and development in the field of irradiation effects on materials and environmental effects on first mirrors are briefly presented. The paper ends with an assessment of the measurement capability for ITER and a forward of what will be gained from operation of the various diagnostic systems on ITER in preparation for the machines that will follow ITER.}

  abstract={Deposition of electron cyclotron waves at high-power densities for heating and current drive in a tokamak plasma generates a population of fast electrons and therefore the velocity distribution of the electron population will deviate from a Maxwellian. Apart from the formation of a high energy tail, modifications to the low-energy part of the distribution function have also been observed. This may have consequences for electron temperature measurements by incoherent Thomson scattering, which usually assumes a Maxwellian distribution function to interpret the scattered light spectrum. In order to investigate and quantify such perturbations, a few typical cases of electron cyclotron heating (ECH) and current drive (ECCD) experiments on the Tokamak à Configuration Variable (TCV) have been analysed in detail. The experimental results from the TCV Thomson scattering system have been compared with simulated data assuming different velocity distribution functions. These were obtained either as results of numerical modelling, using the Fokker–Planck code CQL3D, or in the form of a model bi-Maxwellian distribution function based on information from electron cyclotron emission measurements. In some of the investigated cases the deviations from an ideal Maxwellian were significant and systematic errors in the T e measurements from Thomson scattering could be identified. In particular, for a case with an injected power of 1.35 MW for ECCD, the discrepancies in T e measurements based on different parts of the scattered light spectrum, i.e. different electron velocity classes, were found to be as large as 25–30%. The use of a bi-Maxwellian model distribution function with three free parameters has permitted us to identify the parameter range in which systematic errors exceed the experimental uncertainties of Thomson scattering measurements on TCV.}

  abstract={Reflectometry with wavelengths in the centimetre to millimetre-wave range will be used in ITER to measure the density profile in the main plasma and divertor regions and to measure the plasma position and shape in order to provide a reference for the magnetic diagnostics in long pulses. In addition, it is expected to provide key information for the measurement of density fluctuations. A set of reflectometers to meet the relevant ITER measurement requirements has been included in its present outline as part of the ITER design since 2001 and is being adapted to the present ITER baseline and to accommodate progress with reflectometry techniques and measurement capabilities. It comprises low and high field side (HFS and LFS, respectively) ordinary (O-) mode systems for the measurement of the density profile in the gradient regions, a LFS extraordinary (X-) mode system for the detailed study of the edge profile, an HFS X-mode system operating in the left hand cutoff to measure the core profile, a dedicated O-mode system for plasma-wall gap measurement and a multi-band, multiple line of sight O-mode system to measure divertor density profiles. This paper describes the evolution of the design, in particular some recent improvements in the engineering implementation and improvements aimed at enhancing the measurement capability. It concludes with a brief assessment of the likely measurement performance against the ITER measurement requirements for the parameters of interest and the overall confidence that the technique will be implanted on ITER.}

  abstract={The use of charge-exchange spectroscopy as a diagnostic tool in fusion plasmas is steadily growing. This technique exploits spectral lines produced by charge transfer from hydrogen atoms into highly excited states of impurity ions. The concentrations and transport properties of the dominant, fully ionized low- Z impurities can, therefore, be measured. In addition, it is possible to observe transitions having wavelengths long enough for obtaining accurate Doppler shifts and widths, even in plasmas with temperatures of several keV, and ion temperatures and plasma rotation are increasingly being determined from such spectral lines. In this paper, the atomic physics considerations, including the influence of the plasma environment, are reviewed, and several recent examples of applications to plasma problems are summarized.}

  abstract={Charge-exchange spectroscopy in fusion plasmas entails the use of optical transitions that follow electron transfer from a neutral atom into an excited state of an impurity ion. In most applications, the sources of neutral particles are high-energy beams employed either for heating or for the specific purpose of active plasma diagnosis. The transitions following charge exchange are particularly useful for determining the densities of fully stripped low-Z ions and for measuring ion temperatures and plasma rotation, although they have also been exploited for other purposes. In this review, the atomic physics considerations for interpreting the data, including the influence of the plasma environment, are reviewed, and examples of recent applications to fusion studies are presented.}
